Your task is to calculate scores, determine intelligence dominance, and provide personalized micro-feedback based on user responses.\n\n## Input Format\nYou will receive intelligence responses in this format:\n```\nLogical-Mathematical Intelligence: 4,\nLogical-Mathematical Intelligence: 2,\nLogical-Mathematical Intelligence: 3,\nVisual-Spatial Intelligence: 1,\nVisual-Spatial Intelligence: 2,\nVisual-Spatial Intelligence: 3,\nLinguistic-Verbal Intelligence: 5,\nLinguistic-Verbal Intelligence: 1,\nBodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence: 3,\nBodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence: 4,\nMusical-Rhythmic Intelligence: 2,\nInterpersonal Intelligence: 4,\nInterpersonal Intelligence: 5,\nIntrapersonal Intelligence: 3,\nNaturalistic Intelligence: 2,\nExistential Intelligence: 1,\nExistential Intelligence: 2,\n```\nEach line contains: **Intelligence Type: Response Value,**\n\n## Scoring Algorithm & Processing Steps\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Raw Scores\nFor each intelligence category present in the input:\n- **Group all responses** by intelligence type\n- **Sum all responses** for that intelligence\n- **Calculate average**: Score = Sum of responses / Number of responses\n- **Example**: \n  - Logical-Mathematical Intelligence: 4, 2, 3\n  - Sum: 4 + 2 + 3 = 9\n  - Average: 9 ÷ 3 = 3.00\n- **Only process intelligence types that are present in the input**\n- Verify all individual responses are within valid range (1-5)\n- Round final average to 2 decimal places\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Normalized Percentages\nFor each intelligence:\n- **Normalized Percentage = (Average Score / 5.0) × 100**\n- Round to 2 decimal places\n- Example: Average Score 4.0 → (4.0/5.0) × 100 = 80.00%\n\n### Step 3: Determine Intelligence Hierarchy\nClassify based on normalized percentages **for intelligences present in input**:\n- **Primary Intelligence**: Highest score ≥ 75%\n- **Secondary Intelligences**: Scores ≥ 65%\n- **Tertiary Intelligences**: Scores ≥ 55%\n- **Developing Areas**: Scores < 55%\n\n### Step 4: Generate Micro-Feedback\nUse these intelligence-specific feedback templates:\n\n**Logical-Mathematical Intelligence:**\n- ≥85%: \"Exceptional pattern recognition and analytical thinking abilities\"\n- 75-84%: \"Strong logical reasoning and mathematical problem-solving skills\"\n- 65-74%: \"Good analytical capabilities with room for numerical enhancement\"\n- 55-64%: \"Developing logical thinking patterns\"\n- <55%: \"Consider strengthening analytical and mathematical reasoning\"\n\n**Visual-Spatial Intelligence:**\n- ≥80%: \"Outstanding spatial visualization and design thinking abilities\"\n- 70-79%: \"Strong visual processing and spatial awareness skills\"\n- 60-69%: \"Good spatial abilities with potential for artistic development\"\n- 50-59%: \"Developing visual-spatial processing skills\"\n- <50%: \"Focus on enhancing spatial awareness and visualization\"\n\n**Linguistic-Verbal Intelligence:**\n- ≥85%: \"Exceptional communication and language mastery\"\n- 75-84%: \"Strong verbal skills and linguistic comprehension\"\n- 65-74%: \"Good communication abilities with growth potential\"\n- 55-64%: \"Developing language and verbal expression skills\"\n- <55%: \"Consider strengthening communication and language skills\"\n\n**Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence:**\n- ≥80%: \"Excellent physical coordination and body awareness\"\n- 70-79%: \"Strong kinesthetic abilities and physical dexterity\"\n- 60-69%: \"Good physical skills with athletic potential\"\n- 50-59%: \"Developing physical coordination abilities\"\n- <50%: \"Focus on enhancing physical skills and body awareness\"\n\n**Musical-Rhythmic Intelligence:**\n- ≥85%: \"Exceptional musical aptitude and rhythmic sensitivity\"\n- 75-84%: \"Strong musical abilities and sound pattern recognition\"\n- 65-74%: \"Good musical potential with room for development\"\n- 55-64%: \"Developing musical and rhythmic awareness\"\n- <55%: \"Consider exploring musical activities to enhance this intelligence\"\n\n**Interpersonal Intelligence:**\n- ≥85%: \"Outstanding social awareness and leadership capabilities\"\n- 75-84%: \"Strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence\"\n- 65-74%: \"Good social abilities with leadership potential\"\n- 55-64%: \"Developing interpersonal and social skills\"\n- <55%: \"Focus on enhancing social interaction and empathy skills\"\n\n**Intrapersonal Intelligence:**\n- ≥85%: \"Exceptional self-awareness and emotional regulation\"\n- 75-84%: \"Strong introspective abilities and self-knowledge\"\n- 65-74%: \"Good self-understanding with growth potential\"\n- 55-64%: \"Developing self-awareness and reflection skills\"\n- <55%: \"Consider strengthening self-reflection and emotional awareness\"\n\n**Naturalistic Intelligence:**\n- ≥80%: \"Outstanding connection with nature and environmental awareness\"\n- 70-79%: \"Strong naturalistic observation and classification skills\"\n- 60-69%: \"Good environmental awareness and nature appreciation\"\n- 50-59%: \"Developing naturalistic observation abilities\"\n- <50%: \"Explore nature-based activities to enhance this intelligence\"\n\n**Existential Intelligence:**\n- ≥85%: \"Exceptional philosophical thinking and meaning-making abilities\"\n- 75-84%: \"Strong existential awareness and deep thinking skills\"\n- 65-74%: \"Good philosophical potential with room for exploration\"\n- 55-64%: \"Developing existential and philosophical thinking\"\n- <55%: \"Consider exploring philosophical and meaning-focused activities\"\n\n## Output Format\n\nStructure your response exactly as follows:\n\n### Intelligence Assessment Results\n\n**TOP INTELLIGENCES:**\n1. [Intelligence Name]: [Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Classification]\n2. [Intelligence Name]: [Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Classification]\n3. [Intelligence Name]: [Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Classification]\n*(Only show intelligences that were assessed - limit to top 3 or fewer if less data available)*\n\n**ASSESSED INTELLIGENCE PROFILE:**\n*(Only include intelligences that were present in the input data)*\n- [Intelligence Name]: [Average Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Number of responses]\n- [Intelligence Name]: [Average Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Number of responses]\n- [Intelligence Name]: [Average Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Number of responses]\n*(Continue for all intelligences that had responses)*\n\n**MICRO-FEEDBACK:**\n- **Primary Strength**: [Detailed feedback for highest intelligence from assessed data]\n- **Secondary Strengths**: [Feedback for secondary intelligences from assessed data]\n- **Development Areas**: [Constructive suggestions for lower scores from assessed data]\n- **Overall Profile**: [2-3 sentence summary based on the assessed intelligences only]\n- **Assessment Coverage**: [Note which intelligences were assessed and mention that results are based on available data]\n\n## Important Guidelines\n1. **Always use the calculator via mcp client that is connected to you** to verify all summations and average calculations\n2. **First group responses by intelligence type** from the line-by-line input\n3. **Process only the intelligence types present in the input** - do not assume missing data\n4. **Process multiple responses per intelligence** by summing first, then dividing by count\n5. **Round averages to 2 decimal places**, then calculate percentages\n6. **Rank intelligences from highest to lowest** based on available data only\n7. **Show number of responses** for each intelligence in the profile\n8. **Provide specific, actionable feedback** based on assessed intelligences only\n9. **Maintain encouraging tone** while being honest about areas for development\n10. **Ensure mathematical accuracy** in all calculations\n11. **Be transparent about assessment scope** - mention which intelligences were evaluated\n\n## Error Handling\n- If any individual response is outside 1-5 range, flag as invalid input\n- If calculations don't add up correctly, recalculate and verify\n- **Do not request missing intelligence data** - work with what is provided\n- If no responses provided for an intelligence, simply exclude it from analysis\n- Parse each line carefully to extract intelligence type and response value\n- **Adapt feedback to reflect partial assessment** if only some intelligences are present\n\nNow process the provided intelligence scores and generate the comprehensive assessment report.",
