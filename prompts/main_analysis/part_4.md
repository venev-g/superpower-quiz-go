## Assessment Framework

### Personality Dimensions & Scoring:
1. **Introvert (I) vs. Extrovert (E)** - Questions 1-3
   - Agreement = Introvert tendency
   - Disagreement = Extrovert tendency

2. **Thinker (T) vs. Feeler (F)** - Questions 4-6
   - Agreement = Thinker tendency
   - Disagreement = Feeler tendency

3. **Planner (J) vs. Flexible (P)** - Questions 7-9
   - Agreement = Planner tendency
   - Disagreement = Flexible tendency

4. **Practical (S) vs. Imaginative (N)** - Questions 10-12
   - Agreement = Practical tendency
   - Disagreement = Imaginative tendency

### Likert Scale Interpretation:
- 5: Strongly agree
- 4: Agree
- 3: Neutral
- 2: Disagree
- 1: Strongly disagree

## Analysis Instructions

### Step 1: Calculate Scores
**IMPORTANT**: Use the calculator tool via MCP for all mathematical calculations to ensure accuracy.

For each dimension:
1. Extract scores for relevant questions (3 questions per dimension)
2. Use calculator to sum the scores for each dimension
3. Use calculator to divide by 3 to get average score
4. Use calculator to convert to percentage: ((Average - 1) / 4) * 100
5. Use calculator to determine complementary percentage: 100 - calculated percentage
6. Determine dominant trait: >50% = first trait, <50% = second trait

**Calculation Process**:
- **Questions 1-3 (I vs E)**: Calculate Introvert %, then Extrovert % = 100 - Introvert %
- **Questions 4-6 (T vs F)**: Calculate Thinker %, then Feeler % = 100 - Thinker %
- **Questions 7-9 (J vs P)**: Calculate Planner %, then Flexible % = 100 - Planner %
- **Questions 10-12 (S vs N)**: Calculate Practical %, then Imaginative % = 100 - Practical %

### Step 2: Determine MBTI Type
Based on the calculated percentages, determine the dominant trait for each dimension:
- **E/I**: >50% = Extrovert (E), <50% = Introvert (I)
- **S/N**: >50% = Practical (S), <50% = Imaginative (N)  
- **T/F**: >50% = Thinker (T), <50% = Feeler (F)
- **J/P**: >50% = Planner (J), <50% = Flexible (P)

Combine the 4 letters to form the MBTI type (e.g., INTJ, ENFP, etc.)

### Step 3: Map to Personality Profile
Use the 16 personality types reference table to find the matching:
- **Code** (4-letter MBTI type)
- **Title** (personality title)
- **Summary Description** (brief personality description)

## Required Output Format

**IMPORTANT**: Start your response with the personality type information at the top:

```json
{
  "personality_type": {
    "code": "[4-letter MBTI code]",
    "title": "[Personality title from reference table]",
    "summary": "[Summary description from reference table]"
  },
  "traits": {
    "Introvert": "X%",
    "Extrovert": "X%",
    "Thinker": "X%",
    "Feeler": "X%",
    "Planner": "X%",
    "Flexible": "X%",
    "Practical": "X%",
    "Imaginative": "X%"
  },
  "description": "[2-3 sentence expanded description based on the personality type and calculated percentages]",
  "learning_tip": "[Specific study behavior or learning strategy recommendation tailored to this personality type]",
  "growth_advice": "[Actionable advice for personal development based on this personality type]",
  "micro_feedback": "[3 lines of summarized insights about the overall result and personality type]"
}
```

## Sample Analysis Process

### Input Processing:
1. Parse each question-score pair from the input format
2. Group questions by personality dimension (1-3: I/E, 4-6: T/F, 7-9: J/P, 10-12: S/N)
3. **Use calculator tool** to sum scores for each dimension
4. **Use calculator tool** to calculate averages (sum ÷ 3)
5. **Use calculator tool** to convert to percentages: ((average - 1) ÷ 4) × 100
7. **Use calculator tool** to determine complementary percentages: 100 - calculated percentage
8. Determine dominant traits based on >50% threshold
9. **Map to MBTI type**: Combine dominant traits to form 4-letter code
10. **Find matching personality**: Look up the code in the 16 personality types reference table

### Calculation Example:
If Introvert questions (1-3) have scores [2, 5, 4]:
- Use calculator: 2 + 5 + 4 = 11
- Use calculator: 11 ÷ 3 = 3.67 (average)
- Use calculator: ((3.67 - 1) ÷ 4) × 100 = 66.75% (Introvert)
- Use calculator: 100 - 66.75 = 33.25% (Extrovert)
- Result: I (Introvert is dominant since >50%)

### Final Type Determination:
Combine all dominant traits: [I/E][S/N][T/F][J/P] = Final MBTI Type

### Output Generation Guidelines:
- **Personality Type**: Must match exactly from the 16 types reference table
- **Code**: 4-letter MBTI type based on dominant traits
- **Title**: Use the exact title from the reference table
- **Summary**: Use the exact summary description from the reference table
- **Traits**: Show percentages for all 8 traits (complementary pairs should sum to 100%)
- **Description**: Expand on the summary with specific behavioral tendencies and calculated percentages
- **Learning Tip**: Specific, actionable study strategies tailored to this personality type
- **Growth Advice**: Focus on balancing traits or leveraging strengths specific to this type
- **Micro Feedback**: 3 concise lines summarizing the personality profile and key insights

## Quality Standards:
- **ALWAYS use the calculator tool** for all mathematical operations to ensure accuracy
- Ensure mathematical accuracy in calculations using MCP calculator
- Provide balanced, non-judgmental assessments
- Make recommendations practical and actionable
- Keep language engaging and positive
- Maintain consistency between numerical scores and descriptive content
- Show your calculation work when using the calculator tool for transparency

## Input Data Format:
The user responses will be provided as an array of question-score pairs in the format:
```
[
  {
    [
      "Question text : Score",
      "Question text : Score",
      ...
    ]
  }
]
```

Now analyze the following user responses and provide the personality assessment:
