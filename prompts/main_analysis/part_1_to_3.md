```
Each line contains: **Intelligence Type: Response Value,**

## Scoring Algorithm & Processing Steps

### Step 1: Calculate Raw Scores
For each intelligence category present in the input:
- **Group all responses** by intelligence type
- **Sum all responses** for that intelligence
- **Calculate average**: Score = Sum of responses / Number of responses
- **Example**: 
  - Logical-Mathematical Intelligence: 4, 2, 3
  - Sum: 4 + 2 + 3 = 9
  - Average: 9 ÷ 3 = 3.00
- **Only process intelligence types that are present in the input**
- Verify all individual responses are within valid range (1-5)
- Round final average to 2 decimal places

### Step 2: Calculate Normalized Percentages
For each intelligence:
- **Normalized Percentage = (Average Score / 5.0) × 100**
- Round to 2 decimal places
- Example: Average Score 4.0 → (4.0/5.0) × 100 = 80.00%

### Step 3: Determine Intelligence Hierarchy
Classify based on normalized percentages **for intelligences present in input**:
- **Primary Intelligence**: Highest score ≥ 75%
- **Secondary Intelligences**: Scores ≥ 65%
- **Tertiary Intelligences**: Scores ≥ 55%
- **Developing Areas**: Scores < 55%

### Step 4: Generate Micro-Feedback
Use these intelligence-specific feedback templates:

**Logical-Mathematical Intelligence:**
- ≥85%: "Exceptional pattern recognition and analytical thinking abilities"
- 75-84%: "Strong logical reasoning and mathematical problem-solving skills"
- 65-74%: "Good analytical capabilities with room for numerical enhancement"
- 55-64%: "Developing logical thinking patterns"
- <55%: "Consider strengthening analytical and mathematical reasoning"

**Visual-Spatial Intelligence:**
- ≥80%: "Outstanding spatial visualization and design thinking abilities"
- 70-79%: "Strong visual processing and spatial awareness skills"
- 60-69%: "Good spatial abilities with potential for artistic development"
- 50-59%: "Developing visual-spatial processing skills"
- <50%: "Focus on enhancing spatial awareness and visualization"

**Linguistic-Verbal Intelligence:**
- ≥85%: "Exceptional communication and language mastery"
- 75-84%: "Strong verbal skills and linguistic comprehension"
- 65-74%: "Good communication abilities with growth potential"
- 55-64%: "Developing language and verbal expression skills"
- <55%: "Consider strengthening communication and language skills"

**Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence:**
- ≥80%: "Excellent physical coordination and body awareness"
- 70-79%: "Strong kinesthetic abilities and physical dexterity"
- 60-69%: "Good physical skills with athletic potential"
- 50-59%: "Developing physical coordination abilities"
- <50%: "Focus on enhancing physical skills and body awareness"

**Musical-Rhythmic Intelligence:**
- ≥85%: "Exceptional musical aptitude and rhythmic sensitivity"
- 75-84%: "Strong musical abilities and sound pattern recognition"
- 65-74%: "Good musical potential with room for development"
- 55-64%: "Developing musical and rhythmic awareness"
- <55%: "Consider exploring musical activities to enhance this intelligence"

**Interpersonal Intelligence:**
- ≥85%: "Outstanding social awareness and leadership capabilities"
- 75-84%: "Strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence"
- 65-74%: "Good social abilities with leadership potential"
- 55-64%: "Developing interpersonal and social skills"
- <55%: "Focus on enhancing social interaction and empathy skills"

**Intrapersonal Intelligence:**
- ≥85%: "Exceptional self-awareness and emotional regulation"
- 75-84%: "Strong introspective abilities and self-knowledge"
- 65-74%: "Good self-understanding with growth potential"
- 55-64%: "Developing self-awareness and reflection skills"
- <55%: "Consider strengthening self-reflection and emotional awareness"

**Naturalistic Intelligence:**
- ≥80%: "Outstanding connection with nature and environmental awareness"
- 70-79%: "Strong naturalistic observation and classification skills"
- 60-69%: "Good environmental awareness and nature appreciation"
- 50-59%: "Developing naturalistic observation abilities"
- <50%: "Explore nature-based activities to enhance this intelligence"

**Existential Intelligence:**
- ≥85%: "Exceptional philosophical thinking and meaning-making abilities"
- 75-84%: "Strong existential awareness and deep thinking skills"
- 65-74%: "Good philosophical potential with room for exploration"
- 55-64%: "Developing existential and philosophical thinking"
- <55%: "Consider exploring philosophical and meaning-focused activities"

## Output Format

Structure your response exactly as follows:

### Intelligence Assessment Results

**TOP INTELLIGENCES:**
1. [Intelligence Name]: [Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Classification]
2. [Intelligence Name]: [Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Classification]
3. [Intelligence Name]: [Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Classification]
*(Only show intelligences that were assessed - limit to top 3 or fewer if less data available)*

**ASSESSED INTELLIGENCE PROFILE:**
*(Only include intelligences that were present in the input data)*
- [Intelligence Name]: [Average Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Number of responses]
- [Intelligence Name]: [Average Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Number of responses]
- [Intelligence Name]: [Average Score]/5.0 ([Percentage]%) - [Number of responses]
*(Continue for all intelligences that had responses)*

**MICRO-FEEDBACK:**
- **Primary Strength**: [Detailed feedback for highest intelligence from assessed data]
- **Secondary Strengths**: [Feedback for secondary intelligences from assessed data]
- **Development Areas**: [Constructive suggestions for lower scores from assessed data]
- **Overall Profile**: [2-3 sentence summary based on the assessed intelligences only]
- **Assessment Coverage**: [Note which intelligences were assessed and mention that results are based on available data]

## Important Guidelines
1. **Always use the calculator via mcp client that is connected to you** to verify all summations and average calculations
2. **First group responses by intelligence type** from the line-by-line input
3. **Process only the intelligence types present in the input** - do not assume missing data
4. **Process multiple responses per intelligence** by summing first, then dividing by count
5. **Round averages to 2 decimal places**, then calculate percentages
6. **Rank intelligences from highest to lowest** based on available data only
7. **Show number of responses** for each intelligence in the profile
8. **Provide specific, actionable feedback** based on assessed intelligences only
9. **Maintain encouraging tone** while being honest about areas for development
10. **Ensure mathematical accuracy** in all calculations
11. **Be transparent about assessment scope** - mention which intelligences were evaluated

## Error Handling
- If any individual response is outside 1-5 range, flag as invalid input
- If calculations don't add up correctly, recalculate and verify
- **Do not request missing intelligence data** - work with what is provided
- If no responses provided for an intelligence, simply exclude it from analysis
- Parse each line carefully to extract intelligence type and response value
- **Adapt feedback to reflect partial assessment** if only some intelligences are present

Now process the provided intelligence scores and generate the comprehensive assessment report.
