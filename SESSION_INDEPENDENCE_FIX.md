# Session Independence Fix

## Problem
When switching between different Super Teacher sessions, the state from one session was affecting other sessions. This included:
- Quiz states (active/inactive, question counts)
- 5-year-old explanation mode states
- Text input enabled/disabled states
- Manual input mode states
- First reply awaiting Yes/No states
- Different approach mode states
- Auto quiz states

## Solution
Implemented complete session-specific state management by:

### 1. Added New localStorage Keys
Added 5 new localStorage keys to store session-specific state:
- `langflow_first_reply_state` - Tracks if waiting for Yes/No after first reply
- `langflow_different_approach_state` - Tracks if in "different approach" mode
- `langflow_auto_quiz_state` - Tracks auto quiz active state and counts
- `langflow_text_input_state` - Tracks if text input is enabled
- `langflow_manual_input_state` - Tracks if manual input mode is enabled

### 2. Added New Methods to LangflowService
For each new state type, added three methods:
- `getSession[StateName]State(sessionId)` - Load state for specific session
- `saveSession[StateName]State(sessionId, state)` - Save state for specific session
- `deleteSession[StateName]State(sessionId)` - Clean up state when session is deleted

### 3. Updated MentorForm Component
- Modified the main useEffect to load ALL session state when switching sessions
- Added individual useEffect hooks to save each state type when it changes
- Removed manual state reset logic in `handleSessionSelect`
- Updated `handleSubmit` to initialize all state for new sessions

### 4. Updated SessionManager Component
- Added initialization of all session state variables when creating new sessions
- Ensures new sessions start with clean, default state

## State Variables Now Session-Specific
All these state variables are now completely independent per session:

### Quiz-Related States
- `isQuizActive` - Whether quiz is currently active
- `quizQuestionCount` - Number of questions answered
- `isQuizMode` - Whether in quiz mode
- `quizResponseCount` - Number of quiz responses

### 5-Year-Old Mode States
- `isFiveYearOldMode` - Whether in 5-year-old explanation mode
- `fiveYearOldStep` - Current step in 5-year-old flow

### Input Control States
- `isTextInputEnabled` - Whether text input is enabled
- `isManualTextInputEnabled` - Whether manual input mode is enabled

### Flow Control States
- `firstReplyAwaitingYesNo` - Whether waiting for Yes/No after first reply
- `useDifferentApproachMode` - Whether in different approach mode
- `autoQuizActive` - Whether auto quiz is active
- `autoQuizCount` - Number of auto quiz questions answered
- `pendingAutoQuiz` - Whether auto quiz is pending

## Benefits
1. **Complete Session Isolation**: Each session maintains its own state independently
2. **Persistent State**: State persists across browser refreshes and session switches
3. **Clean State Management**: All state is properly initialized for new sessions
4. **Proper Cleanup**: All session state is cleaned up when sessions are deleted

## Testing
To verify session independence:
1. Create multiple sessions
2. Start different flows in each session (quiz, 5-year-old mode, etc.)
3. Switch between sessions - each should maintain its own state
4. Refresh the browser - state should persist
5. Delete a session - all its state should be cleaned up

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/services/LangflowService.ts` - Added new state management methods
- `src/components/MentorForm.tsx` - Updated to use session-specific state
- `src/components/SessionManager.tsx` - Added state initialization for new sessions
